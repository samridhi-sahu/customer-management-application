# Customer Management System
# Overview
This Customer Management System is a robust and scalable solution developed in Golang, utilizing the Gin web framework for RESTful routing, MySQL for data storage, gRPC for efficient client-server communication, and GraphQL for flexible data querying. Docker is employed for containerization, simplifying deployment processes, ensuring scalability, and maintaining system integrity.

# Features
Gin Web Framework: Leverages the Gin web framework for efficient and performant RESTful routing and middleware handling.

MySQL Database: Utilizes MySQL as the database management system to store and manage customer-related data.

gRPC APIs with Protocol Buffers: Implements gRPC APIs using Protocol Buffers, showcasing the efficiency of client-server communication.

GraphQL Layer: Provides a GraphQL layer for flexible data querying, allowing clients to request only the data they need.

REST Layer: Provides a Rest layer to handle routing and middlewares for logging, which helps in performance management.

Docker Containerization: Uses Docker to containerize the application, streamlining deployment processes, enhancing scalability, and ensuring maintainability.

# Prerequisites
Golang: Ensure you have Golang installed on your machine.
Docker: Install Docker for containerization.
